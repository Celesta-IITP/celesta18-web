  Problem Statement:
</section>
<article>
Chemoquest is a theme based treasure hunt. The competition comprises of a multi-level hunt for chemical compounds and then perform a chemical reaction with those compounds. The event will start from the given venue where the first riddle will be given. The contestants must have to solve the  riddle to reach the next spot where they will get the next riddle .  After collecting all the chemical compounds, the team has to perform the chemical reaction. The team that takes the minimum time to complete the whole task will be declared as winner . <br>
