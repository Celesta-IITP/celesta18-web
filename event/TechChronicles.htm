     This pre-celesta event gives the prolific writer in you a chance, a chance to cross the horizons of imagination, to expand the field of one’s view and plot a sci-fi story. It will be your story so it can be anything, literally anything - Alien invasion to humans going to another planet or time-travelling and what not!
      <br><br>
     <b>So just think outside the box, use your imagination, bend the scope of view and write a thriller!</b>
