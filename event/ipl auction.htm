  Ever thought what you would do if you got a chance to build your own IPL team. To use your knowledge of the ‘Big Game’ and your sixth sense to create the perfect team that goes on to lift the coveted Trophy. To use permutation and combination and make the best choice keeping in mind the huge investment that goes into putting together a winning team. To learn Strategizing, Resource management, Entrepreneurship, all at the same time in a fun-filled Cricketing event. It has been truly said <b>”The biggest risk is not taking any risk...In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks”</b>.Thereforebe ready to take risks while bidding on the players. “Being busy does not always mean real work. The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends there must be forethought, system, planning, intelligence, and honest purpose, as well as perspiration. Seeming to do is not doing”.Hence strategize with your team members before you bid for a player. This Celesta its going to be a lot of fun 
  so fasten your seat belts and be ready to grab the opportunity of building your very own IPL team!
