<div id="introcont">The first bridges built by humans were probably just wooden planks or boulders
placed on a flowing stream. But today, engineers have built bridges to cross vast stretches of
rivers. Before actually constructing a bridge, we need to model it and test its performance in the
lab. Celesta brings you a chance of showing your engineering skills with noodles! So, get
innovative and build your bridge model with this unconventional construction material.</div><hr>

spaghetti noodles satisfying the constraints stated below.</strong></li></ul></div> <hr>

	The teams shall mail a zip file containing the abstract of their design to
ace@iitp.ac.in . The abstract should contain the following:
· Drawings of the design (isometric and orthographic views) with proper dimensioning on
AutoCAD or clear pictures of handmade sketches. Clearly state the specifications and
advantages of your design and any innovative idea that you have.
· Analysis of the design according to the dimensions specified in the problem statement in a
simulation software namely Bridge Designer 2017. The analysis is mandatory. Workshop for the
same shall be conducted. The teams will be shortlisted for Round 2 on the basis of their
abstracts.
