  Rules:
</section>
<article>
1.The team will consist of  3   members.<br>
2.The Government team (the side in favour) shall sit on the right hand side of the Speaker. The Opposition (the side against) shall sit on<br> the left.<br>
3.The motion/agenda will be  provided 15 minutes before the start of any debate to the respective teams.<br>
4.During the rebuttal, Members (debaters) may not bring up any new arguments or new evidence except in direct refutation of material which <br>has already been presented.<br>
5.The speaking order will be as follows:<br>
-The Prime Minister(3 minutes).<br>
-The Leader of Opposition(3 minutes)<br>
-The Minister of the Crown (second Government speaker) (2 minutes)<br>
-The Leader of the Opposition (second Opposition speaker). (2 minutes)<br>
-Third Government speaker will give closing statement .(1 minute  30 seconds)<br>
-Third Opposition  speaker will give closing statement .(1 minute 30 seconds)<br>
-.Finally the Prime Minister will deliver the Government rebuttal.(2 minutes)<br>
6.Points of Information are raised while another Member has the floor (i.e. is speaking). If a Member wishes to raise a Point of <br>Information, he/she should stand and with one hand on their head and another pointing forward (in teapot-style) and say: “On that point”. <br> The person who is speaking may refuse to take the point saying: “Not at this time.” Alternatively, they may to choose to take the point.<br> If the speaker refuses the point, the Member raising the POI must sit down. Otherwise, they should deliver their point as succinctly as <br>possible (in less than 15 seconds) Often the point is phrased as a question. All speakers should attempt to both deliver at least one POI <br>and to accept one POI during the course of the debate. <br>
7.All remarks must be addressed to the Speaker of the House and not to anyone else, e.g. say “Mr. Speaker” not “Mr. Speaker, honourable<br> judges”. The Member must address Mr. Speaker in his/her first sentence.<br>
8.The Government must define the resolution. Their definition must be accepted unless it is undebatable or unreasonable. If the Opposition <br>wishes to challenge the definition they must do so prior to the start of the debate by appealing to the tournament organiser. The <br>Opposition must show that the Government’s definition is unacceptable and then substitute their own. Definitions may not be challenged <br>during the debate.<br>
9.The Government may introduce a plan for implementing the resolution if they wish to, but they are not required to do so. If they do <br>propose a plan, they must fully explain it during the Prime Minister’s speech.<br>
10.If, and only if, the Government introduces a plan, the Opposition may introduce a counter-plan, but it is not required to do so. A<br> counter-plan is an alternative method of implementing the resolution which is significantly different from the Government plan and is <br>demonstrably better than the Government plan. If the Opposition wants to introduce a counter-plan, they must fully explain it during the <br>address of their first speaker.<br>
11.Props (e.g. drawings, models) may not be used. <br>
12.Debaters should treat each other with respect and judges will penalise debaters guilty of flippancy, discourtesy, or any attempt to <br>belittle another debater. <br>
13.Use of internet is allowed.<br>
