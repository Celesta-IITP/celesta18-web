<b>Training Module:</b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4hn7Cj7SCCUZE1oSGMyYkFyWkU/view">Link to Module</a><br>
Name of the Workshop: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence<br>
<br>
Duration: 2 Days<br>

Take Away: Certification and Software Digital toolkit<br>
<br>
HIGHLIGHTS:<br>

COMPUTERS ARE ABLE TO SEE, HEAR AND LEARN. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE.<br>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two very hot<br>
buzzwords right now, and often seem to be used interchangeably.<br>

They are not quite the same thing, but the perception that they are can<br>
sometimes lead to some confusion. Both terms crop up very frequently when<br>
the topic is Big Data, analytics, and the broader waves of technological<br>
change which are sweeping through our world.<br>

In short, the best answer is that:<br>

Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to<br>
carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”.<br>

And,<br>

Machine Learning is a current application of AI based around the idea that<br>
we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them<br>
learn for themselves.<br>
Learn the whole new concept of AI and ML and this can change your life over<br>
years. Learn to know HOW, WHEN and WHY...<br>
Do come to see the future world.. Enter it and Explore it... on 14 and 15<br>
October.<br>
