Participants have to analyze a problem statement given on the spot and have to give solution to the problem depending on the emotion of the hat that they are wearing.<br>It will allow emotion and skepticism to be brought into what might normally be a purely rational process, and it will open up the opportunity for creativity within decision making.<br>This event will cultivate a sense of taking sounder and more resilient decisions than would otherwise be the case. It will help participants to avoid possible pitfalls before they have committed to a decision.","organised":"Ramakrishna and Shubhham Chouksey","contact":"8985265942, 9479917417","rules":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tEOwfYatV5zOkhQlLxBk1BR2tAXyWcKQ/view"}
