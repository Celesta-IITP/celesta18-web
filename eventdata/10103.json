    "about": "Are you that budding engineer who gets super-excited while tinkering with chemicals? Are you amazed by the variety and versatility of reactions that happen to matter around us? Then this is the right platform for you to experiment with your ideas. Come and reproduce a mechanism with the help of your knowledge in chemistry and engineering skills in order to automate the switch of an electric circuit we've got ready for you. The aim is to make the mechanism turn off the switch of the circuit within the specified time. So bounce those exemplary ideas off your brain, 'coz the stage is set for Chem-e- switch. ",
