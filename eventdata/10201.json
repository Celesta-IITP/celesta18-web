    "about": "NJATH, aptly the acronym for Not Just Another Treasure Hunt is an unconventional online gaming event, wherein participants from all over the world take part to solve nerve-racking questions for 51 hours, in an attempt to outwit everyone else and top the coveted NJATH leaderboard. IIT Patna's very own online crypt hunt that, just like fine wine, only gets better with time, the standard being increased by leaps and bounds each year. The best of brains compete and lock horns with each other, in this seemingly simple game, to procure the answer from the hints provided. The answer, may appear to be right in front of the beholder, but may require a series of steps before actually reaching the correct way out. Or, it may just be the other way round. Slack off comfortably on your couches and rejoice yourself in the ecstasy of suspense and thrill as the wings of your imagination flatter unceasingly in the quest of finding the right answer. NJATH, apart from being an experience to be cherished forever, also proves propitious in enhancing one's aptitude, reasoning and the ability to think out of the box. ",
