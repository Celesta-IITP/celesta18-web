{"name":"Graffiti","catagory":"Non Tech","date":"","time":"","venue":"","about":"It’s time to bend the rules and let your creativity flow unbridled! Let the walls that remain unscathed by the flow of time be reminded that they do not limit oneself and that we create our own fate, we are the owners of our own design. And to scale these walls, we don’t always need our might, for our greatest weapon is our imagination! This year, Celesta brings you Graffiti, an event where you get to break the normal traditions of drawing and painting and try your own free style to win exciting prizes that await your arrival! The spray cans will be provided during the event itself. The interested can participate in a team of 3-4 members. Revolt against your inner demons and let the artist in yourself free from the cages of your desire!","organised":"Rakshit Maheshwari","contact":"9939512017","rules":""}
