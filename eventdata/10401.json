A story that doesn’t end on the pitch, a smoke that refuses to fade, the ancients that are yet to fall. The dust hasn’t settled yet, wounds still fresh, and the dying embers still flicker. We are once again at a new juncture, a chance for redemption, a chance to prove worthy, a chance to rise up once again and battle your way against all odds to promiseland. The time has come once again. Come be a part of this glorious battle and put your skills to test in FIFA, CSGO and DOTA2 and fight all the way to top. Show no mercy, make most of the moment, clutch it, score it, and be God-like!!!<br><br>","organised":"Harshit Singh(FIFA), Pranil(CSGO), Anshul Koshiyari(DOTA2), Kshitij Jain(PUBG Mobile)","contact":"7355674747, 6201169731, 8356975835, 9131604185","rules":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H5qt-6DU7uwvtbjSKk79tMu8ZSVLnwMO"}
